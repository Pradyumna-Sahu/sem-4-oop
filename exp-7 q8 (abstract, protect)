/* JAVA Program to Create an abstract class called figure which contains a pure virtual function called find_area() and
a protected attribute named as area. Create two new derived classes from the above class named as
circle and square having double type attribute named as radius and side respectively. Implement
dynamic polymorphism to find out area of a circle and a square and show the result.
