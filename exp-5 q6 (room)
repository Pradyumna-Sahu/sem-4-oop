// JAVA Program to define a class called Room with the follwing attributes 1.length, 2.breadth, 3.height, 4.florr_area, 5.Wall_area, 6.No.of_fans. 7.No.of_windows, 8.no.of_doors. Define a suitable constructor and a method to display details of a room. Assume that 20% of the total wall area is occupied by doors and windows.
