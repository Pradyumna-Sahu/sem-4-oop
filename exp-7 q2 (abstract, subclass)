/* JAVA Program to Define an abstract class “Staff” with members name and address. Define two subclasses of this
class – “FullTimeStaff” (department, salary) and “PartTimeStaff” (numberof- hours, rate-per-hour). 
Define appropriate constructors. Create n objects which could be of either FullTimeStaff or
PartTimeStaff class by asking the user’s choice. Display details of all “FullTimeStaff” objects and
all “PartTimeStaff” objects.
